## GAME DESCRIPTION

*Connect 4* is a game of concentration and skill very well known and practiced by adults and children.

### PLAYERS

It is played one on one for a maximum total of two players.

### CHESSBOARD

The game board is composed of a plastic structure, most of the times of blue color, easy to disassemble and assemble inside which, thanks to the presence of vertical guides, the checkers slide until depositing on each other. The checkers are instead of hard plastic and two different colors, yellow and red for a total of twenty-one elements. Shape and weight are practical, there are however table versions and travel versions with smaller dimensions.

### RULES

Players decide via counts which of the two will start the game(in the case of our program will start the player 1). In turn they will then slide their checker in the tracks from the board trying to align four checkers in a horizontal row, vertical or oblique. In the meantime, they have to be careful of the opponent’s moves to avoid that he can also make four stacking his own. It is very important to stay focused and study your opponent’s moves. In case neither of the two participants in the game managed to make "four" the game ends in a draw and another one starts.

### RATING

The winner is the player who first aligns four pieces of the same colour horizontally, vertically or obliquely.

### PURPOSE

The aim of the game is to be able to align four pieces of the same color in the game board either vertically, horizontally or obliquely.
